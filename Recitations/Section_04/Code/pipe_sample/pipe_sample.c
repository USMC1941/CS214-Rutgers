/* Author: Hanxiong Chen
 * ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * This demo code is to show how to create multi-processes
 * and send a sequence of messages to their parents.
 * The structure is:
 * Process: A --create-> B --create-> C --create-> D
 * Message: A <-pid_cd-- B <--pid_d-- C <-nothing- D
 * 
 * My code will try to create four processes. D is the la-
 * st process to be created. I will send all the pids to \
 * the first porcess and try to print out all of them.
 *
 * D send nothing to C, and C send the pid of D to B. B r-
 * eceive the msg of D and append the pid of C, then send
 * to its parent A. A will printout all the pids it gets.
 *
 * To understand this code, you need to know that fork() \
 * will keep    all the variable status until you call f-
 * ork(). That means all the arrays and variables shoud h-
 * ave the same values. If you want your child process to
 * have the same values as parent process, make sure to do
 * that before fork(). Everything after fork can be diffe-
 * rent.
 *
 * To compile:
 *   $ gcc -o test ./pipe_sample.c 
 * */
