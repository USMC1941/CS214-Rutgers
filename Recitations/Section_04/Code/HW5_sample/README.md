# HW5 Sample

In [hw5_sample.c](hw5_sample.c), I wrote a sample code for the `ls`
homework. I also write some instructions to your next assignment.
To compile, please do

```sh
gcc -o test ./hw5_sample.c -g
```

then run

```sh
./test
```

It will recursively searching the files and directory under current directory by default.

Enjoy.
