# Project Help

## Description

1. To compile:

   ```sh
   gcc -o proj1 ./proj1_sample.c -std=gnu99
   ```

2. Please check the `pipe_sample.c` file first. I just merge that code with `hw5_sample.c` to make this one works. Most of the explanations are already given in the `.c` file as comments. Here is to give you a layout of the project:

   Once there is a file, you do fork. This pair of processes (child and parent processes) only handle one file. Once the child process is done, the parent process will report its child's pid to its parent:

   eg.

   ```
   A --create--> B --create--> C (sorting file)
   A <--pid_c--- B <-Nothing-- C (done)
   ```

   So we can see, the pair of processes for a file only need to send one pid to the parent.

   Once there is a directory, you do fork. This pair of processes do differnt things: child process will process everything under given directory (new directories under current directory or files). This child process may create other child process if there is a new directory under current dir.

   Parent process just wait for the child process to be done. If the child process is done, that means everything under current directory are already processed correctly. This time parent process will receive a message from its child process. This message may contains all the pids that it created when processing current directory. Parent process need to append its child process pid and then send this message to its parent.

   Here I draw pictures to show why I must use break at the end of the child process part instead of using `exit(0)` directly.

## Example

Here is a directory layout

```
./ --> dir1 | file1 | file2
         |
      --> dir2 | file3
            |
         --> file 4
```

1. The first target is a directory `dir1`, do fork. This time we get child `p0'`. The same as `p0`.
   ```
   p0         p0'
   ---       ---
   |   |     |   |
   |   |     |   |
   |   |     |   |
   ---       ---
   ```
2. Since this is a directory, we recursively call function. So we go one level down. This time we are under `dir1`. Then we find that the first target under `dir1` is another directory `dir2`. So we fork to get `p0''` to handle this directory.
   ```
               p0'        p0''
               ---         ---
            |   |       |   |
            |  -|-      |  -|-
            | |   |     | |   |
            --   |      --   |
             |   |       |   |
             ---         ---
   ```
3. `p0''` is processing `dir2`, we need to go one level down to enter `dir2`. Now we are under `dir2`. Then we find the target is a file. We do fork, to get `p0'''`.
   ```
                        p0''        p0'''
                           ---         ---
                           |   |       |   |
                        |  -|-      |  -|-
                        | |   |     | |   |
                        --  -|-     --  -|-
                        | |   |     | |   |
                           --   |      --   |
                        |	  |	      |   |
                           ---         ---
   ```
4. Since `p0'''` copied the stack structure of `p0''`, once the file processing is done, `p0'''` need to return to previous function call. Then `p0'''` terminate and `p0''` will send message to `p0'`.

   Here you can see the reason why I say we cannot use `exit(0)` at the end of the child process part. We must use break to allow the `p0'''` to return to the first level and free all the allocated memories to avoid memory leak.

   ```
                        p0''        p0'''         p0'''       p0'''
                        ---         ---            ---
                        |   |       |   |          |   |
                        |  -|-      |  -|-         |  -|-        ---
                        | |   |     | |   |        | |   |      |   |
                        --  -|-     --  -|-   -->  --   |  --> |   |
                        | |   |     | |   |        |   |      |   |
                           --   |      --   |         ---        ---
                        |	  |	      |   |
                           ---         ---
   ```
