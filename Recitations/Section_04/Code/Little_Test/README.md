# Little Test

Here I wrote a little program to show you how to write header files and how to include header files and then use the function or variables from other source file.

Put all the files under the same directory and then run the script. If script is not a executable file, you can do

```sh
chmod +x ./scrip
```

and then run the script. Then you can see some outputs.
