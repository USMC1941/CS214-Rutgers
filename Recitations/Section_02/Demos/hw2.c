/*
1. Write some code that declares two arrays of size 10 that are string literals.
        
Make a pointer to one of the arrays, cast it to be an int pointer, and print out its value.

Make a new integer, set it equal to the value of your int pointer, then make a pointer to that integer, cast it to be a char pointer, and print out 8 chars.

                                   What happened? Why?

A common technique is for string literals to be put in "read-only-data" section which gets mapped into the process space as read-only (which is why you can't change it).

It does vary by platform. For example, simpler chip architectures may not support read-only memory segments so the data segment will be writable.

Rather then try to figure out a trick to make string literals changeable (it will be highly dependent on your platform and could change over time), just use arrays:
