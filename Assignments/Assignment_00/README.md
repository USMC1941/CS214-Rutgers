# CS214 Project 0: Basic Data Sorter

### Title: The Sorter Part 0

## Abstract

This is the first in a series of projects that will involve sorting a large amount of data. 

In this first phase, you will write a simple C program to sort a list of records of movies from IMDb alphabetically by the data in a given column.

All projects will be done in groups. Group signups will go out later this week. One submission per group.

## Introduction

The input file will be a CSV or comma-separated value file, which is a simple way to represent a database table. In a CSV file each line is one record (or row). Commas are separators that denote different types of values per record (columns). 

Very often the first record (row) of a CSV is a list of value types (column headings):

```
food,calories,fat
soup,200,12
pie,500,25
celery,-10,0
```

Your code will be given a CSV as well as a value type (column heading) to sort on. Your code will then need to read in the CSV, sort it on the given value type and output the sorted version of the CSV.

Sorting the CSV above on the 'food' value type:

```
food,calories,fat
celery,-10,0
pie,500,25
soup,200,12
```

Sorting the CSV above on the 'calories' value type:

```
food,calories,fat
celery,-10,0
soup,200,12
pie,500,25
```

## Methadology
### a. Parameters

Your code will read the records through ` <standard input> (STDIN)`. 

Remember, the first record (line) is the column headings and should not be sorted as data. 

Your code must take in a command-line parameter to determine which value type (column) to sort on. If that parameter is not present (?-> throw an error, or default behavior). 

The first argument to your program will be `'-c'` to indicate sorting by column and the second will be the column name:

```sh
./sorter -c food
```
     
> Be sure to check that the arguments are there and that they correspond to a listed value type (column heading) in the CSV.


### b. Operation

Your code will be reading the CSV to be sorted from `STDIN`. In order to run your code to test it, you will need to open the CSV and read it in to the `STDIN` for your code:

```sh
cat input.file | ./sorter -c  movie_title
```

The line above, if entered on the terminal, will open the file `"input.file"` and read it in to some executing code named `"sorter"`, which was invoked with the parameters `"-c"` and `"movie_title"`.

Your code's output will be a new CSV file outputted to `STDOUT`. You should output each record line by line using `printf`.

For testing purposes you can redirect `STDOUT` to a file:

```sh
cat input.file | ./sorter -c  movie_title > sortedmovies.csv
```


### c. Structure

Your code should use Mergesort to do the actual sorting of records. It is a powerful algorithm with an excellent average case.
 
It is strongly suggested that you use structs internally to represent each record in the CSV coming in as input.
 
In order to help you do both of these, please use a user-defined header file named `sorter.h`. We have attached one to the assignment description with some simple comments in it.
 
If you write any other definitions, typedefs, structs, unions or large helper functions (>~25 lines), be sure to put them in your header file and document them.

## Results
Submit your `"sorter.c"`, `"sorter.h"` and `"mergesort.c"` as well as any other source files your header file references.

* Document your design, assumptions, difficulties you had and testing procedure. 
* Include any test CSV files you used in your documentation.
*  Be sure to also include a short description of how to use your code. 
*  Look at the man pages for suggestions on format and content. 
*  Do not neglect your header file.
*  Be sure to describe the contents of it and why you needed them.

## Extra Credit
Here are some extra credit options for you. You can choose to do either, both, or neither.

### Extra Credit (10 points):
Find something interesting about the data set. Analyze/mine the data for interesting statistics. Include a discussion of the algorithm and your findings.

### Extra Credit (10 points):
Find a way to generalize your sorter given *any* CSV file. Include a discussion of the algorithm and any additional metadata you might require.

## Project Part 0 FAQ

#### Q> When sorting by the item which is type of string, the sort rule is A-Z or lexicographic orderï¼Ÿ

A> The default should be lexicographical order (i.e. how `strcmp` evaluates strings)  

#### Q> For the column of color, there is a blank before "Black and White", should it be considered during sorting?

A> For all fields, one should trim leading and trailing whitespace

#### Q> What about the items with null value? should them be considered during sorting?

A> It is sufficient to move all null items to the beginning of the sorted list, in the order they appear in the original list

#### Q> Will the grader use a different CSV?

A> The grader will use a different CSV, but it will adhere to the format given in the assignment


#### Q> Should the sorting be ascending or descending?

A> Ascending (you can always parse a command line parameter to do the opposite)

#### Q> What are the types of the fields?
